# Graphistry in a standard React project

This demo modifies a standard [Create React App](https://create-react-app.dev/) project to use Graphistry:

## Try

```bash
npm i
npm run start
```

A browser window should launch that loads a React page that embeds a visualization from Graphistry Hub

## Key files

* [package.json](package.json) for installation
* [src/index.js](src/index.js) for global CSS import
* [src/App.js](src/App.js) for `<Graphistry>` component import and sample use
